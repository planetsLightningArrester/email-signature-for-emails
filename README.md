# HTML signature for emails

![Example](./assets/example.png "Nice")

## How-to
1. Change `profile.png` and `signature.png` to yours
1. Double-click on `table-based.html`
1. Select all, copy, and paste on your email
1. Customize as you want. `table-based.html` is as simple and commented as possible. You can also customize the icons under `assets/icons` or add more! You can also refer to external links icons/assets.
1. Gmail tends to mess up things. Outlook have nicer results
1. Thank you're welcome

## Devs
* No clue why, but using `div`s instead of `table`s mess everything on Gmail/Outlook. Code 20% test 80%.
* Never use `position: absolute`. Gmail goes crazy
* Would Bootstrap work?
